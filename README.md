## Reproduction repo - airstack hub issue

Airstack hub doesn't seem to work as in documentaion [https://docs.airstack.xyz/airstack-docs-and-faqs/farcaster/farcaster-hubs/quickstart/grpc-api](https://docs.airstack.xyz/airstack-docs-and-faqs/farcaster/farcaster-hubs/quickstart/grpc-api).

Neynar hub works as expected.

AIRSTACK HUB ERROR: `HubError: Received message larger than max (169877536 vs 4194304)`

Maybe hub version not updated?
